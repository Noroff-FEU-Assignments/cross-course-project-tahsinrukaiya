       <h1>OUR BRAND HISTORY</h1>
       <p>
         The RAINYDAYS raincoat selling store started in the 1990s as 
         a small family-run business. My father John, a trained tailor,
          launched the store in a small town named Lillestrøm.He focused 
          in producing and selling raincoats for both men and women. 
          At the beginning, the shop was slow going.He had to fight 
          back with other regional stores, and the raincoat market wasn’t as
           popular then as it is now. But his passion to quality, artistry 
           and skills soon paid off. Name of his store spread, and RAINYDAYS 
           began to attract customers from all over the region. Soon RAINYDAYS 
           launched additional stores across Norway. In addition to selling 
           traditional raincoats, the RAINYDAYS also selling stylish raincoats
           with a range of colors and designs. RAINYDAYS were always looking
         for ways to develop and stay ahead of the competition. In the late 1999s, 
         RAINYDAYS began selling raincoats made from recycled materials. 
         This was an innovative concept at the time and assisted RAINYDAYS
         to attract new generation customers who were more conscious of
         nvironmental issues. Over the years, RAINYDAYS has expanded its
         offerings to include a wide range of rainwear, such as rain jackets,
         capes, umbrellas and waterproof boots, to it’s collection.

          You will never go wrong wearing our product. We are concern of environment 
          and sustainability. All of our rain jackets are waterproof and windproof.
